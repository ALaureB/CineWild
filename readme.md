# CineWild
App built at the occasion of a 6 hours exam at the Wild Code School. We had to code back end in Node / Express and front end in React on a movie theme.

## First step : launch back end
- open a terminal and go to the back folder
- yarn
- node bin/www
- Back end will open in http://localhost:3000/

## Second step : launch front end :
- open a new terminal and go to the front folder
- yarn
- yarn start
- React front end will open on another localhost port.
