# CineWild
App built at the occasion of a 6 hours exam at the Wild Code School. We had to code back end in Node / Express and front end in React on a movie theme.

To launch it :
* First locally launch back end :
- open a terminal and go the the back folder.
- yarn
- node bin/www
=> Back end will open in http://localhost:3000/.

* Then launch front end :
- open a new terminal and go 
- yarn
- yarn start
=> React front end will open on another localhost port.
